<h1>AWS Threat Composer</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>AWS Threat Composer</strong> repository! üéâ</p>

<p>This application is designed to help you understand and manage potential security threats in your AWS environment. By leveraging AWS services, it provides a straightforward way to visualize, compose, and simulate threat scenarios, enabling you to enhance your security posture effectively. Think of it as your personal security orchestrator, bringing together various AWS services to combat threats seamlessly!</p>

<h2>üåü What is AWS Threat Composer?</h2>

<p>The <strong>AWS Threat Composer</strong> is a powerful tool that integrates various AWS services to model potential security threats. It allows users to simulate attack vectors, evaluate security measures, and provide insights on how to mitigate risks effectively. It's an invaluable resource for security professionals aiming to bolster their cloud security strategy.</p>

<h2>üìã About the Project</h2>

<p>This project showcases how to harness AWS capabilities to build a comprehensive threat modelling application. It demonstrates the integration of services like ECS, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and more, enabling users to craft detailed threat scenarios that mimic real-world attacks.</p>

<h3>Key Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)</strong>: The backbone of our application, ECS allows us to deploy and manage containerized applications with ease. It offers scalability and reliability, essential for handling varying loads of threat simulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong>: ALB manages incoming traffic to our services, ensuring requests are distributed efficiently across containers. It also provides advanced routing features, making it easier to direct traffic based on rules, which is particularly useful in a threat modelling scenario.</li>
    <li><strong>Terraform</strong>: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) at its best! With Terraform, I‚Äôve automated the deployment of all the necessary AWS resources, from VPCs and ECS clusters to security groups and IAM roles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üèóÔ∏è High-Level Overview</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs how everything fits together:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> manages DNS for the application, ensuring users can access it seamlessly.</li>
    <li><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong> routes incoming traffic to the appropriate ECS services based on defined rules, enhancing both performance and security.</li>
    <li>The application runs within an <strong>ECS cluster</strong> on <strong>AWS</strong>, which is set up using <strong>Terraform</strong> for automated resource management.</li>
    <li>All infrastructure is codified with <strong>Terraform</strong>, making it easy to replicate and manage.</li>
</ol>

<p>This project serves as a practical example of how AWS services can be integrated to create a robust threat modelling application, providing both learning and real-world application of cloud security strategies!</p>
